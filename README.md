# libact-lite: Pool-based Active Learning in Python

Lite version of the [libact](https://github.com/ntucllab/libact) package by Yao-Yuan Yang, Shao-Chuan Lee, Yu-An Chung, Tung-En Wu, Si-An Chen and Hsuan-Tien Lin. 

The libact package is great, altough it is a bit hard to install. This 'lite' version strips all components that need compilation (SVM and variance reduction). The framework still working.
